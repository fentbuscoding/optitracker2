## Verified Servers, Automatic Banning, & Member Scanning
> Verified Servers can now be applied for by server owners / admins who DM the bot with a server ID
- Verified Servers can be identified by looking at the guilds `v!banlist` embed, verified servers will show a distinct footer letting you know. This is also how you can tell if your server has been accepted for verification!

> Difference between non verified (top) and verified (bottom) servers

### How It Works
- You will be added to a waitlist
- An auditor will check your banlist for non-vorth alts
- If all good, you get accepted & your ban list is added to the **GLOBAL BAN LIST**

> Your name also gets cemented forever if its in the reason (if you're banning using a bot most of the time by default it is)

## Global Ban List
> If the bot has the `ban members` permission, you can run `v!setup` or `v!massban` to automatically ban this list
- The list can be viewed publicly, and is updated soon as a new verified server is added
- The list is an array of ids, allowing for carl-bot users to `.massban` in their own server, without needing the bot

## Banning Users
- Easy to use
- `v!ban`, `v!setup`, `v!massban`, all work as the same command

- Keeps the original reason from the user who first banned them

- Gives live updates based on how much progress has been made

## Verification Process & DM Flow
- The bot must be in the server it is trying to verify, if not, you will see this

- You must only send SERVER IDs to the bot.

> Verification requests get sent to me (soon to be multiple people if this scales)

> On the observer side, this is what we see

## Potential for larger lists
- Pedophiles, Weirdos, and other bad actors can be added to the list, VORTH is just how you can describe those people (think of it as a handy umbrella term), anyone banned with that "vorth" tag, has done insanely depolorable things that nobody even wants to learn about. Thats the criteria for adding to the list. Please use your best judgement, or we will
